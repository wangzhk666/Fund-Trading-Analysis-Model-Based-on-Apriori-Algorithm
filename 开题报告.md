## 1 Project Tittle

Fund Trading Analysis Model Based on Apriori Algorithm

## 2 Purpose and Significance

With the development and progress of society, more and more college students begin to learn how to manage money and invest. For college students who have just stepped into society, the fund is a good choice with low risk and low investment threshold. In this era of big data, rational use of big data is the key to people's success. If we can create a model that can make recommendations by analyzing the fund's previous ups and downs, then we will be safer and more convenient to invest in.

## 3 Literature review

We investigated the investment decision making methods in today's popular quantitative trading,  which can be roughly divided into the following two categories. Traditional empirical strategies  based on historical data analysis have distilled subjective trading rules (represented by riding the  wind and trend tracking strategies proposed by Wang [1]) and investment strategies based on  neural networks (represented by ANN applied by Rajashree [2]). The first kind of method has a  good performance at present, but it is criticized for its high subjective participation. And because  the second type of method is limited by poor interpretability, there is no way to prove the  effectiveness of the strategy in principle. 

Based on this, we are going to propose a Fuzzy trading model. By referring to the relevant definitions  and properties ([3] [4]) and the fuzzy method of technical indicators proposed by Yao [5], we want to establish our own fuzzy indicators, use Aproori algorithm to generate association rules  and obtain buy and sell judgment signals. Finally, we will evaluate our model by referring to some  common indicators [6] [7].

## 4 The Guiding Ideology

Insist on seeking truth from facts, adhere to the people-centered scientific concept of development.

## 5 Writing Goals

This project aims to use the existing Apriori algorithm framework to put forward a practical fund investment analysis model, which can learn and train according to the historical transaction price and predict the future price trend. It can provide trading signals to investors according to the day's transaction price, to help investors make as objective a judgment as possible.
On this basis, a simulated investor is set up, given a certain amount of investment, according to the model trained by the data of different funds output decision results for investment, to choose the highest benefit of the fund to invest.

## 6 Research Method

The main research method of this project is experimental method. Based on the literature research, the relevant mathematical model was established, and the experimental data were input to continuously optimize the relevant parameters to improve the accuracy of the model prediction and the stability of the model itself.
